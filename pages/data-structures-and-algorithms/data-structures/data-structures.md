# Data Structures

Data structure is a format for storing, managing and working with or structuring data or information. For example, arrays and linked lists.

## Abstract Data Types (ADTs)

An abstract data type (ADT) is a specification of the desired behaviour from the point of view of the user of the data.

A data structure is a concrete representation of data, and this is from the point of view of an implementer, not a user.

Distinction is subtle but similar to the difference between a computational problems and an algorithm.
